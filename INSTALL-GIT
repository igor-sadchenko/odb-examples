The following instructions describe how to work with the source code that was
checked out from the git repository.

The major difference between using a released source code package and source
code from the repository is that the former does not contain autotools-based
makefiles or Visual Studio project files. Instead, it contains templates for
these files as well as its own, custom build system. This build system is
used for development as well as to automatically generate the autotools and
Visual Studio files.

This file describes how to use this build system to build the package as well
as to create a release-ready source distribution which contains the autotools
build system and Visual Studio project files.


Prerequisites
=============

Besides the prerequisites listed in the INSTALL file, you will need the
following additional packages:

  - GNU bash >= 2.0.0   http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/
  - GNU make >= 3.81    http://www.gnu.org/software/make/
  - build    >= latest  http://www.codesynthesis.com/projects/build/

If you are planning to create the source code distributions, then you will
also need the following packages:

  - GNU m4   >= 1.4.0   http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/
  - GNU sed  >= 4.0.0   http://www.gnu.org/software/sed/
  - tofrodos >= 1.7.0   http://www.thefreecountry.com/tofrodos/

As we as the GNU autotools:

  - GNU libtool  >= 2.2.6b  http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/
  - GNU autoconf >= 2.67    http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/
  - GNU automake >= 1.11.1  http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/

Any reasonably up to date GNU/Linux installation would normally have all of
the above packages already present, except for build and maybe tofrodos.


Configuring and Building
========================

To build the source code simply run make in the root directory of the package.
The first time you run make, the build process will also configure the
package by asking you several questions. On the subsequent runs, make will
only rebuild what has changed.

To run the automated test suite (if any), run 'make test'. To clean the object
files, executables, etc., run 'make clean'. To de-configure the package (that
is, to remove configuration files in addition to objects, executables, etc.),
run 'make disfigure'.


Creating Distribution
=====================

To create the source code distribution, use the dist make target as well as
the dist_prefix variable to specify the directory where the distribution files
should be placed. For example:

make dist dist_prefix=/tmp/package-1.1.0

Once the distribution files are ready, change to the distribution directory
and run the bootstrap script to bootstrap the autotools build system, for
example:

cd /tmp/package-1.1.0
./bootsrap

To create the source code archives, use the autotools build system. First
configuring the package (see the INSTALL file for more information on this
step) and then use the dist target to make the archives, for example:

./configure
make dist
